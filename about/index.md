## About Me

Hi! I Joanne, a current senior at UCSD, studying Cognitive Science with a 
specialization in Human Computer Interaction.

I have always had a passion for social good, and have loved volunteering at 
various non profits and community centers since I was young. 

When I became an HCI major, a lot of the projects I designed had a social good 
flair to them, as you will see in my portfolio. The aspect of being able to design
beautiful things that helped the world become a better place really spoke to me 
as a person and gave me a purpose. 

I hope to marry my two passions in design and social good in my career!
