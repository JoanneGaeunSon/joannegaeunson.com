## About Me

Hi Everyone! I'm Joanne, a current senior in college who is a globetrotter-in-training! 

I am a Cognitive Science major specializing in Human Computer Interaction, so this blog serves both as a side project and a way for me to record and share my travels.

My hobbies include cooking, photography, eating, and travelling (of course), and you'll see a lot of those things on this blog :) 

Feel free to reach out to me via <u>joannegaeunson@gmail.com</u> for any inqueries or suggestions!

## About the Content

I am currently studying abroad in Florence, and will move on to Sicily and Barcelona in the next 15 weeks! Throughout my time here I will be flying/training to other European countries. Expect many food pictures, reviews, how-to'a, reflections, and other random musings that I have throughout my time here. Requests for certain posts are definitely welcome! I am very new to the blog scene so please bear with me as I develop my blogging style :) 

## About the Tech

After a lot of toying around with different platforms and consulting friends, I decided to utilize Jekyll on the Github Pages platform. (Shoutout to Joel Sequeira for the recommendation, and Isaac Diamand for the DNS help!) I found a template that I really liked online, and modified it to add style elements in addition to commenting and subscription capabilities. As this blog is also a web development side project, expect new features to be added and/or modified throughout its lifespan!
