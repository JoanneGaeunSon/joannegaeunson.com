Everyone knows the scene- Anton the food critic, indifferently eyes the Rattatouille dish that Alfredo has brought to him, a look of disdain on his face.
He cocks his pen, as if readying his weapon, and with his other hand, brings the fork up dramatically to take a bite.

And then suddenly, Anton is not in the restaurant, but his childhood self, remembering the warmth and love that his mother's homemade rattaouille provided for him on
a bad day.

I always envied that moment, and wondered if it would ever come to me.

Ironically so, we actually learned about the connection of food to memory in one of my courses here in Florence, and the importance of the tastes and smells of food in consolidating memories.
But nothing could prepare me for the experience I had.

## What were two broke college students doing at a premiere Florentine culinary event anyway?

It was mostly by dumb luck. My little Kyle and I were planning on going out to a fancy dinner when he visited me in Florence, and we
had chosen the restaurant by picking a random restaurant on the Michelin Guide. We arrived at our reservation time (7pm) but the door of the restaurant was still locked and barred.
Puzzled, we called the restaurant, and discovered that a special event was to take place that night, in which a guest Michelin starred chef from Milan and the resident chef had created a
special menu for the night. Because we already had a reservation for the night, they honored that reservation and gave us a table at the event.

Once we got into the venue, we were promptly handed two glasses of champagne, and whisked away to the social hour, where we quickly realized that we
were the youngest people in the room... by far.

Waiters dressed in crisp white shirts and sleek black slacks walked around with gleaming silver trays filled with hors d'oeuvres.

We targetted the youngest couple there to socialize with because a. they were speaking English, and b. they were the only other Asians in the room.
They were from Canada and were taking a detour on their way home from a wedding in Paris.

The chefs introduced themselves to us, and we were seated at our table soon after.

## Is this food or art?!

Each course was exquisitely plated, reminiscent of those works of modern art that we all have seen but never truly understood at SFMOMA.
(my skepticism towards modern art will be saved for another time)

Each ingredient within each dish was so perfectly paired with the others, not to mention the glasses of wine that the sommelier poured and described
to us at the beginning of each course.

It was the third course which lead to probably the best culinary experience I'd ever had

## The Rattatouille moment

The dish itself was simple- a risotto (rice dish) with porcini mushrooms and saffron. Out of all the other dishes that we had,  it was the most
simply plated.

But once I tasted it, I was immediately transported back to my childhood dining room table, when my mother would put a steaming bowl of cream of mushroom soup mixed with rice and veggies in front of me.

Even though the ingredients on my plate were so far removed from the 99 cent can of Campbell's cream of mushroom that my mother's dish came from, it reminded me of home, and how much I missed it. It was mind boggling how I was able to relate the two wildly different experiences. I suddenly had a deep understanding about how Anton felt, my eyes tearing up a little just thinking about home and my mother's cooking.

Although these experiences are in no way exclusive to Michelin starred restaurants, I think the unexpectedness of it evoked a stronger emotional response within me. Amongst the sparkling glasses of champagne, foie gras, and crisp white tablecloths, I was able to find a piece of familiarity on a plate in a country so far away from home.
