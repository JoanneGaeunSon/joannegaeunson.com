As someone who has been on about twenty flights both domestic and international within the last year, I have consistently opted to sit in the window seat, if possible. The only two times that I didn't were due to them being last-minute purchases. The experiences I had during these two flights were drastically different.

Here are a couple of the reasons why I think the window seat is the best choice for any given flight.


## Reason #1: It's the window seat. (Duh)

Strictly speaking of visuals, the window seat is 100% the way to go. If you're sitting in an aisle seat, you get to see people shuffling down the aisle on the way to the bathroom. Honestly, that's a little too much information about total strangers that I don't need to know. If you sit in a middle seat, you get to see the back of the heads of the passengers in front of you, and possibly the occasional child peek over the seat head, although I guess it's fun to make goofy faces at them until they laugh ( I'm not speaking from experience at all ;) ). The aisle seat however... You get to see the world. Literally. 

When you're flying over water, you can scrutinize the vastness of the ocean, watching the waves undulate in a therapeutically rhythmic manner. 

When you're flying over land, you get to follow the crevices and peaks etched onto the surface beautiful Mother Earth. You get to see toy-sized cars on miniscule highways, wondering who is in them and where they are going. I love watching the world outside as if it is a tiny world that I'm far removed from. At night, you get to see the twinkling lights of cities below, and the concentrations of brightly lit buildings contrasting the vast blackness of the contryside.

My favorite moment in air was on a flight from the South Africa to Qatar where the sun was setting and we were literally chasing the sunset. Because of the direction I was going in, and the timing of the flight, I got to see the gorgeous orange, pink, and red hues of the sky for a good 30 minutes. 

Also, who doesn't like a good old fashioned Instagram post from an airplane window with a profound quote about travelling as the caption?

## Reason #2: That awkward moment when you rest your head on a stranger's shoulder.

Also not speaking from experience. Alright... you got me. It was on a flight from Washington DC to San Francisco. My flight was at 6am, which meant I had to get up at 3am to get to the aiport on time. Needless to say, I was exhausted. It was a full flight, and due to it being a last minute purchase, I was put in one of the last availible seats- a middle seat near the very back. Armed with my eye mask, neck pillow, wireless headphones, and "Simp" playlist on Spotify, I was determined to reclaim the sleep that had been so coldly robbed from me. 

Once we were up in the air, I was out like a light. Because it was a small domestic flight, the chairs reclined back maybe an inch, which I thought would be fine because I had my handy dandy neck pillow. I had never been more wrong. 

I tend to move around a lot in my sleep, and when my body is strapped down into an airplane seat, that means that only part of me could freely move about: my head. And boy did it move- I basically spent thirty minutes of waking up every ten seconds due to my neck being uncomfortably strained and my head bent down in the forward position. A couple of times, it ended up on the shoulder of the passenger next to me, who THANK GOD was a kindly old lady who insisted it was okay when I profusely apologized. Needless to say, I got very little sleep and was mortified about the whole affair. I eventually gave up on sleep, and decided to read my book. I couldn't even entertain myself by looking out the window because well, I was in the middle seat.

Whenever I'm in the window seat, I'm able to lean my head against the window, allowing the most comfort and security that an economy seat in a domestic flight can provide. Furthermore, when the window seat is taken, on less crowded flights, it is less likely that someone will take a middle seat, allowing a cushion between me and other passengers, sometimes even giving me an entire row.

## Reason #3: E.Coli is not your friend.

Everyone's biggest qualm about the window seat is the fact that you have bother the two people next to you and do an insanely awkward shuffle in order to get out of your seat and on your way to the bathroom.

My question to those people is <i>why on earth would you want to go to the bathroom on an airplane in the first place</i>?

According to a study in the Times magazine, E.Coli was found on the toilet set, bathroom handle, and even the sink of many airplane bathrooms which you can [read here](http://time.com/4877041/dirtiest-places-on-airplanes/). If you think about it, an airplane is an enclosed, controlled environment. It has to be or else the air pressure would be impossible for humans to survive in. Imagine all the germs that fester in the tiny water closets that anywhere from 50 to 100 people have used in the span of the last few hours. Albeit, airplane cabins, by nature of being air sealed, are pretty much germ infested anyways, but adding to the already overbearing amount of exposure to germs is just not on my agenda. I tend to see to my business right before my plane and refrain from taking in too many liquids during my journey in order to avoid the bathroom at all costs.

I'm curious to know about other peoples' experiences, so feel free to comment if you feel differently!
